[ipynb](https://github.com/josephbaib/da_portfolio/blob/main/final_mobile_usersgroup/mobile_app_usersgroup.ipynb)

## Project Description

Determine the user behavior of a product sales app based on metrics

## Tools ##

- **Python**
- **Seaborn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Stats**
- **Math**

##

## Overall output

- The number of users is decreasing.
- The retention rate is also decreasing.
- No differences in conversion between download sources (Google and Yandex) were found.
- Most users have made a one-time login to the application - it is worth working on the interface.
- It is worth redesigning "maps", as the conversion rate is lower there - most likely they discourage users a lot.
- We need to encourage sellers to add photos.
- Most likely the "recommendations" section is updated too infrequently, you need to check this.
