## General conclusion

 Analysis of the real estate market in St. Petersburg showed that the city's average price is strongly influenced by indicators such as: the size of the area, number of rooms, ceiling height, as well as parks and ponds nearby - which is logical, because these factors are valued in any metropolis. On average, one-bedroom apartments with ceiling height of about 2.4 meters dominate in the city. In the center of St. Petersburg the ceiling height is not so important, although it is dominated by the value of 2.7 meters - it is a historic part of town, the ceilings are high a priori everywhere, people are more important floor area, a balcony for admiring the architecture of the city, the number of rooms and kitchen size.
