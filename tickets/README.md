## General conclusion

Conducting an analysis of Yandex.Afisha we can say that mobile devices have a very low income relative to computers. Particular attention to sources 9 and 10 - we need to understand the reasons for low income. The most profitable sources are 1, 2, 9 and 5. And the most financially burdensome source 3, perhaps on it you can cut costs without reducing CAC. In general, you should pay more attention to the mobile app, why it is such a low income, perhaps awkward interface or a lot of bugs - more tests are needed. The most profitable months - the end of autumn-beginning of winter, people start buying gifts for the New Year, often it may be tickets to events. Spending on marketing peaks in December, and the cost per customer in this month is closer to the lower boundary of this indicator - people succumb to advertising without much opposition. Despite the abundance of summer festivals - summer remains a dead season compared to the rest. Also users make purchases during the first minutes of using the service, but mostly the number does not come back for a second purchase - the reasons should be investigated.
