## General conclusion

- There are problems with the product page - it is worth paying attention to it and running additional tests.
- In general Group B users show slightly worse results.
- Separately, it should be noted that the testing was conducted during the New Year vacations, which complicates the analysis, especially this kind of analysis. Moreover, a marketing event fell on this period. It should be done again at a better time.
- Also the testing period exceeded the recommended by 2 days, questioning the competence of the test
- Users in both test groups were found in the tests
