## General conclusion.

When you reduce the number of months remaining, the probability of renewal decreases, it is worth it:

- Conduct additional outreach to customers who are running out of subscriptions.
That is, the program "subscription" with a monthly renewal in this case does not work, you should try to sell immediately from 6 months (discounts, bonuses, additional preferences).

In this case, apparently, group classes are a hook for customers. Accordingly suggested:

- Do a customer survey of the strengths and weaknesses of group classes and work through them, making them even better;
- To find out why the gym itself without group classes doesn't appeal to customers and work out the weaknesses (few specific machines, small showers, no cooler, etc.)
